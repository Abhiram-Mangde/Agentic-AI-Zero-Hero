# The Agentic Loop

The agentic loop is the cycle through which agents interact with their environment, make decisions, and learn from outcomes.

## Steps in the Agentic Loop
1. **Perceive:** Gather information from the environment using sensors.
2. **Reason:** Analyze inputs, consult memory, and plan actions.
3. **Act:** Execute chosen actions using actuators.
4. **Learn:** Update memory and strategies based on results.

## Diagram
```
Perceive → Reason → Act → Learn → (repeat)
```

## Real-World Analogy
- **Self-Driving Car:**
	- Perceives road and traffic conditions
	- Reasons about best route and speed
	- Acts by steering and accelerating
	- Learns from driving experience to improve safety

## Why It Matters
The agentic loop is the foundation of intelligent behavior. Mastering it enables you to build agents that adapt and improve over time.

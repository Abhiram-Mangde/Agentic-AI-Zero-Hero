# Agents vs Bots: Key Distinctions

Understanding the difference between agents and bots is essential for building intelligent systems.

## Definitions
- **Agent:** An autonomous entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, learns from experience, and acts to achieve goals.
- **Bot:** A software program that performs automated, rule-based tasks, often without learning or adaptation.

## Comparison Table
| Feature         | Agent                        | Bot                        |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Autonomy       | High                         | Low                        |
| Learning       | Yes                          | No                         |
| Decision-Making| Dynamic                      | Predefined                 |
| Adaptability   | Adapts to new situations     | Follows fixed rules        |
| Examples       | Self-driving car, trading bot| Chatbot, web scraper       |

## Real-Life Examples
- **Agent:** A smart thermostat learns your schedule and adjusts temperature automatically.
- **Bot:** A chatbot answers FAQs using a fixed set of responses.

## Why It Matters
Agents are the foundation of advanced AI systems, while bots are useful for simple automation. Knowing the difference helps you design the right solution for your needs.

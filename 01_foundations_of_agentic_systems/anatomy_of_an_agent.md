# Anatomy of an Agent

Agents are made up of several key components that work together to perceive, reason, and act.

## Core Components
- **Sensors:** Gather information from the environment (e.g., cameras, microphones, APIs).
- **Memory:** Store past experiences, facts, and learned knowledge.
- **Decision-Making Engine:** Processes inputs, applies logic, and chooses actions.
- **Actuators:** Carry out actions in the environment (e.g., motors, sending messages, updating databases).

## Practical Example
- **Smart Assistant:**
	- Sensors: Microphone (listens to commands)
	- Memory: Remembers your preferences
	- Decision-Making: Decides what action to take (set alarm, play music)
	- Actuators: Speaks response, controls devices

## Why It Matters
Understanding agent anatomy helps you design and build effective, intelligent systems.

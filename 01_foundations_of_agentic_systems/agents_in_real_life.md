# Agents in Everyday Life

Agents are all around us, powering many technologies we use daily.

## Case Studies
- **Smart Assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant):**
	- Listen to voice commands, reason about intent, act by providing information or controlling devices.
- **Automated Trading Systems:**
	- Analyze market data, make buy/sell decisions, learn from outcomes to improve strategies.
- **Robotic Vacuum Cleaners:**
	- Perceive room layout, plan cleaning path, act by moving and cleaning, learn to avoid obstacles.
- **Customer Service Chatbots:**
	- Understand queries, search for answers, respond, and learn from feedback.

## Practical Scenario
Imagine a smart home agent that manages lighting, temperature, and security based on your habits and preferences. It perceives your presence, reasons about comfort, acts to adjust settings, and learns to optimize energy use.

## Why It Matters
Seeing agents in action helps you understand their potential and inspires ideas for your own projects.

# Agentic Loop Explained
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Agents work in loops: they sense, think, act, and repeat.

## Simple Explanation
Imagine a robot vacuum:
1. Senses dirt (input)
2. Decides where to clean (processing)
3. Cleans (output)
4. Repeats until done

## Example
A chatbot:
- Listens to you
- Figures out what you want
- Responds
- Waits for your next message

## Mini Task
- Draw a loop showing how an agent works.

## Exercise
- Watch a smart device in action. Can you spot its loop?

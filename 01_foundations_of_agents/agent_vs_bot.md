# Agent vs Bot
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Agents are smart and can make decisions. Bots follow simple rules and scripts.

## Simple Explanation
An agent is like a personal assistant who can think for themselves. A bot is like a vending machineâ€”it does what it's told, nothing more.

## Example
- **Agent**: A smart home system that learns your habits.
- **Bot**: An auto-reply on social media.

## Mini Task
- List 2 agents and 2 bots you know.

## Exercise
- Can you think of a bot that could be improved by making it an agent?

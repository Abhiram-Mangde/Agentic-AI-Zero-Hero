# Anatomy of an Agent
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Agents have parts that help them sense, think, and act.

## Simple Explanation
Just like people have eyes, brains, and hands, agents have ways to see (input), think (processing), and do things (output).

## Example
A smart assistant:
- Listens to your voice (input)
- Understands what you want (processing)
- Replies or does something (output)

## Mini Task
- Draw a simple agent: label its input, processing, and output parts.

## Exercise
- Imagine a robot agent. What would its input, processing, and output be?

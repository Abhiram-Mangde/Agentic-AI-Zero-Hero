## TL;DR
An agent is like a smart helper that can do tasks for you, make decisions, and learn from experience.

## Simple Explanation
Imagine a video game character that can move, talk, and solve puzzles on its own. That's an agent!

## Example
A chatbot that helps you book tickets or a robot vacuum that cleans your house are both agents.

## Mini Task
- Think of something in your home that acts like an agent. What does it do?

## Exercise

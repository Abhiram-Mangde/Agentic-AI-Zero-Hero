# Project 4: Code Writer Agent
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Build an agent that can help you write simple code, even if you’re new to programming.

## Simple Steps
1. Choose a platform (MetaGPT, ChatGPT, etc.)
2. Write a prompt: "Write a program that says hello."
3. Ask the agent to explain the code.

## Example
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Mini Task
- Ask your agent to write a simple program for you.

## Exercise
- Change the code and see what happens.

# Project 2: Web Researcher
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Create an agent that can help you find information online.

## Simple Steps
1. Choose a platform (ChatGPT, CrewAI, etc.)
2. Write a prompt: "Find the latest news about AI."
3. Ask the agent to summarize what it finds.

## Example
"Summarize the top 3 articles about AI in 2025."

## Mini Task
- Ask your agent to find and summarize a topic you’re interested in.

## Exercise
- Compare the summaries from two different agents.

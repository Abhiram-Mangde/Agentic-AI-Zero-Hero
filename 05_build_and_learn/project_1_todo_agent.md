# Project 1: To-Do Agent
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
Build an agent that helps you manage your daily tasks.

## Simple Steps
1. Choose a platform (ChatGPT, Replit, etc.)
2. Write a prompt: "Help me make a to-do list."
3. Add tasks and ask the agent to remind you.

## Example
"Remind me to finish my homework at 6 PM."

## Mini Task
- Make a to-do list with 3 tasks and ask your agent to help you track them.

## Exercise

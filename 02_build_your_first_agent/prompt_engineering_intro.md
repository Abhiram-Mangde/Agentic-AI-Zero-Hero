# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art of designing effective instructions for AI agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs).

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt is the input or instruction you give to an AI agent to guide its response.

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important?
- **Improves accuracy:** Well-crafted prompts lead to better answers.
- **Enables complex tasks:** Prompts can guide agents to perform multi-step reasoning.
- **Reduces errors:** Clear prompts minimize misunderstandings.

## Strategies for Effective Prompts
- Be specific: "Summarize this article in three sentences."
- Provide context: "You are a helpful assistant."
- Use examples: "Translate 'hello' to French."

## Hands-On Exercise
Try these prompts with ChatGPT or any LLM:
1. "List three benefits of agentic AI."
2. "Write Python code for a calculator agent."
3. "Explain the difference between agents and bots."

## Advanced Tips
- Chain prompts for multi-step tasks.
- Use feedback to refine your prompts.

# Difference Between AI, ML, and DL
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
AI is the big idea. ML (Machine Learning) is a way for computers to learn from data. DL (Deep Learning) is a special kind of ML that uses lots of layers (like a big sandwich).

## Simple Explanation
- **AI**: Any computer doing smart things.
- **ML**: Computers learning from examples (like learning to recognize cats by seeing lots of cat pictures).
- **DL**: Computers using lots of layers to learn really complex things (like understanding speech).

## Analogy
AI is like a school. ML is a classroom. DL is a super advanced class with lots of teachers.

## Mini Task
- Draw a picture showing AI, ML, and DL as parts of a school.

## Exercise
- Find an app that says it uses "AI". Does it use ML or DL too?

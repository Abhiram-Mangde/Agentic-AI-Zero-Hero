# What is AI?
<!-- TOC -->

## TL;DR
AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It means making computers do things that usually need human smarts, like understanding language or recognizing pictures.

## Simple Explanation
Imagine you have a robot friend who can play games, answer questions, or help you with homework. If it can learn, solve problems, or talk like a person, that's AI!

## Relatable Example
Think of AI like a smart assistant on your phone (like Siri or Google Assistant). It listens, understands, and helps you out.

## Mini Task
- List 3 things you use every day that might use AI (hint: apps, websites, gadgets).

## Exercise

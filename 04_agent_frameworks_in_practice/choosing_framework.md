# Choosing the Right Framework

Selecting the best agent framework depends on your goals, technical skills, and project requirements.

## Decision Guide
Ask yourself:
- What is the main goal of my agent? (e.g., automation, research, coding)
- Do I need multi-agent collaboration?
- What programming languages and tools do I prefer?
- How important is scalability and performance?

## Framework Comparison Table
| Framework  | Best For           | Complexity | Community Support |
|------------|--------------------|------------|------------------|
| AutoGPT    | Automation         | Medium     | High             |
| BabyAGI    | Prototyping        | Low        | Medium           |
| CrewAI     | Collaboration      | High       | Growing          |
| MetaGPT    | Code Generation    | Medium     | Niche            |

## Practical Advice
- Start with a simple framework for learning.
- Read documentation and join user communities.
- Experiment with small projects before scaling up.

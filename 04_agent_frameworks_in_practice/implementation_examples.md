# Real-life Implementation Examples

Explore how agent frameworks are used in real-world projects to solve practical problems.

## Case Study 1: AutoGPT for Market Research
- **Goal:** Automate competitor analysis.
- **Process:** AutoGPT searches the web, summarizes findings, and generates a report.
- **Code Sample:**
```python
# Pseudocode for AutoGPT agent
def run_autogpt_task(task):
	# Use LLM to break down task
	subtasks = llm_plan(task)
	for subtask in subtasks:
		result = tool_use(subtask)
		print(result)
```

## Case Study 2: CrewAI for Team Collaboration
- **Goal:** Multiple agents work together to write a research paper.
- **Process:** Each agent handles a section, shares findings, and integrates content.
- **Code Sample:**
```python
# Pseudocode for CrewAI collaboration
agents = [Agent(role) for role in ["Introduction", "Methods", "Results"]]
for agent in agents:
	agent.work()
	agent.share()
```

## Case Study 3: MetaGPT for Code Generation
- **Goal:** Automate code writing for a web app.
- **Process:** MetaGPT generates boilerplate code, refactors, and reviews.
- **Code Sample:**
```python
# Pseudocode for MetaGPT code agent
code = metagpt.generate("Create login page")
print(code)
```

## Practical Takeaway
Choose frameworks and strategies that match your projectâ€™s needs. Experiment and iterate for best results.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Key Concepts
- **Learning:** AI systems improve their performance over time by analyzing data and experiences.
- **Reasoning:** AI can make decisions based on rules, logic, and available information.
- **Perception:** AI can interpret sensory input (images, sounds, text) to understand the world.
- **Natural Language Processing:** AI can understand and generate human language.

## Real-World Examples
- **Virtual Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to voice commands.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Netflix and Amazon suggest products and movies based on your preferences.
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Use AI to perceive surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely.
- **Healthcare:** AI helps diagnose diseases, recommend treatments, and analyze medical images.

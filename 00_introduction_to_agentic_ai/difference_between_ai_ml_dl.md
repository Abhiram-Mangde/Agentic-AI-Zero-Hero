# Difference Between AI, ML, and DL

Understanding the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) is key to mastering modern agentic systems.

## Definitions
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** The broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligence.
- **ML (Machine Learning):** A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
- **DL (Deep Learning):** A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to solve complex problems like image and speech recognition.

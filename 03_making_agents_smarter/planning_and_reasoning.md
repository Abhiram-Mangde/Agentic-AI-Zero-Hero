# Planning & Reasoning Strategies

Agents use planning and reasoning to decide what actions to take and how to achieve their goals.

## Planning
- **Goal Setting:** Define what the agent wants to accomplish.
- **Action Sequencing:** Determine the steps needed to reach the goal.
- **Adaptation:** Change plans based on new information.

## Reasoning
- **Logical Thinking:** Use rules and facts to make decisions.
- **Inference:** Draw conclusions from available data.
- **Problem Solving:** Find solutions to challenges.

## Practical Example: Simple Planner Agent
```python
class PlannerAgent:
	def __init__(self):
		self.goal = None
		self.plan = []

	def set_goal(self, goal):
		self.goal = goal
		print(f"Goal set: {goal}")

	def create_plan(self, steps):
		self.plan = steps
		print("Plan:")
		for step in self.plan:
			print(f"- {step}")

# Example usage
agent = PlannerAgent()
agent.set_goal("Build a chatbot")
agent.create_plan(["Design conversation flow", "Write code", "Test bot"])
```

## Real-Life Example
Navigation apps plan routes and reason about traffic to get you to your destination efficiently.
